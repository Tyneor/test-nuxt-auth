## Credits

The front is heavily inspired by this Youtube tutorial : [Nuxt Auth - Authentication and Authorization in NuxtJS by Vue Screencasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzUpO8tXoaw)

The back uses this npm package : [JSON Server Auth](https://github.com/jeremyben/json-server-auth) and the code to get the `/user` route working is heavily inspired by this GitHub issue : [How to get user profile](https://github.com/jeremyben/json-server-auth/issues/12)
